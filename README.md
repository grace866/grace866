### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Grace, and I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania interested in computer graphics and animation. I'm also exploring other areas such as data processing and web development!

-  I recently collaborated with a group to create AIvsHuman, a 2D horror game made with Unity. This was made in one day, over the course of the 2025 UPGRADE gamejam. Check out my project here! [Check out my project here!](https://github.com/grace866/AIvsHumanUPGRADE)
- I'm also working on a 3D game based on Overcooked with my UPGRADE team members. 
- Iâ€™m currently taking CIS 1210 (Data Structures and Algorithms), CIS 2620 (Automata, Computability, & Complexity), STAT 4300 (Probability), and PHYS 0151 (Principles Of Physics II: Electromagnetism And Radiation)
