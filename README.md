### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Grace, and I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania interested in computer graphics and animation. I'm also exploring other areas such as data processing and web development!

- Iâ€™m currently working on creating a music app for studying using the Spotify API and improving my Blender skills
- I recently built a 3D game based on Overcooked with my UPGRADE team members
- Iâ€™m currently taking CIS 1210 (Data Structures and Algorithms), CIS 2620 (Automata, Computability, & Complexity), STAT 4300 (Probability), and OIDD 2550 (Artificial Intelligence, Business, & Society)
